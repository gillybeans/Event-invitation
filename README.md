A school assignment between a Web Development student and a school's IP Form &amp; Graphics student. Our goal is to create an event invitation in digital and physical form for a company - the event is NOT real and is only for this assignment. I've been tasked to create an event invitation landing page in <b>HTML, CSS & JavaScript</b> based of designs and sketches given to me by my group member. 
<br><br>
We have picked a GAMING-party Event for a company that creates their own gaming/cosplay cons. This specific event is to launch in april 2021 that will be gaming oriantated and have a lot tournaments in games, cosplays and will end the weekend with a big party; both in-game and in-real-life. This is fake by the way.

## Personalization
A part of the assignment was to create personalized invitations as well.

## Code Review

-Seems to be built 'responsive' and not 'mobile first', if you use the Inspector Toggle device function
On our phones (though both small and old) the hero is a bit long and you have to scroll to the side/zoom out to see the burger.

-We recommend to have a confirmation message after signup

-There's a breakpoint where JOIN in the header disappears

-A11y: consider using aria labels for accessability, also alt text on images (for SEO and a11y)

-Super awesome and lots of animations!! 
-Nice with the real links in footer!

Really cool site
